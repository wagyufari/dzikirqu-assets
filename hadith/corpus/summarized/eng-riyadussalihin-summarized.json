His son reminded him of the glad tidings he received from the Prophet ﷺ.  \n\n- **Transformation & Faith:**\n  - Initially, he *hated* the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and even *wanted* to kill him.  \n  - Later, Allah *guided* him to love Islam.  \n  - He eagerly sought to pledge allegiance but wanted to set conditions—**forgiveness** being paramount.\n\n- **Important Islamic Teachings:**\n  - *Islam erases past sins* (through faith, migration, and pilgrimage).  \n  - The **best assurance** at death is to affirm *La ilaha illallah* and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.  \n\n- **Respect & Reverence for the Prophet ﷺ:**  \n  His respect was profound; the Prophet’s ﷺ beauty and stature were so bright that 'Amr couldn't look at him for long.  \n\n- **Final Wishes:**\n  - No mourning or fire should accompany his burial.  \n  - His grave should be covered gently, and standing over it for a short time (like the time it takes to slaughter and distribute a camel) is advised to reflect and request Allah’s mercy.  \n\n> *\"The best thing which you can count upon is the affirmation that: La ilaha illallah\"* — a testament to the core of Islamic faith.  \n\n**🔚 This hadith highlights the power of sincere repentance, the significance of Shahada, and the Prophet's ﷺ esteemed position in a believer's life.**"
