They entered it, and a rock fell from the mountain, blocking the entrance to the cave. They said: Nothing can save you from this rock except that you invoke Allah with your righteous deeds. One of them said: O Allah, I had two aged parents, and I never gave food to anyone before them, nor to my family or wealth. One day, I was driven away by seeking trees, and I did not return to them until they slept. I milked their evening portion for them, and I found them sleeping. I disliked waking them up, and giving food to anyone before them, nor to my family or wealth. So I stayed - and the cup was in my hand - waiting for them to wake up until dawn broke, and the children were crying at my feet. They woke up and drank their evening portion. O Allah, if I did that seeking Your Face, then relieve us of what we are in because of this rock. So it moved a little, but they could not get out. The second said: O Allah, I had a cousin, who was the most beloved person to me. In one narration: I loved her as much as men love women. I wanted her to submit to me, but she refused until a year of hardship befell her. She came to me, and I gave her one hundred and twenty dinars on the condition that she submit to me. She did, until when I was able to reach her... In one narration: When I sat between her legs, she said: Fear Allah, and do not break the seal except by its right. So I turned away from her, though she was the most beloved person to me, and I left the gold that I had given her. O Allah, if I did that seeking Your Face, then relieve us of what we are in. So the rock moved, but they could still not get out. The third said: O Allah, I hired laborers and gave them their wages, except for one man who left his due and went away. His wages grew until a lot of wealth was amassed from it. After a while, he came to me and said: O Abdullah, give me my wages. I said: All that you see of your wages: the camels, the cattle, the sheep, and the slaves. He said: O Abdullah, do not mock me! I said: I do not mock you. He took it all and drove it away, leaving nothing of it. O Allah, if I did that seeking Your Face, then relieve us of what we are in. So the rock moved, and they went out walking. (Agreed upon).

Go to such and such a land, for there are people there who worship Allah the Almighty. So worship Allah with them, and do not return to your land, for it is an evil land.'

The angels of mercy said, 'He came as a penitent, turning his heart to Allah the Almighty.' The angels of punishment said, 'He has done no good deeds at all.' Then an angel in the form of a human came to them, and they made him an arbitrator between them. He said, 'Measure the distance between the two lands. Whichever he is closer to, he belongs to them.'

      "text": "And from Abdullah bin Ka'b bin Malik, who was the guide of Ka'b, may Allah be pleased with him, from his sons when he went blind, he said: I heard Ka'b bin Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, narrating his story when he lagged behind the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, in the expedition of Tabuk. Ka'b said: I never lagged behind the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, in any expedition he undertook except for the expedition of Tabuk. However, I did lag behind in the expedition of Badr, and no one was censured for lagging behind him. The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, and the Muslims went out only for the caravan of Quraysh, until Allah the Almighty gathered them and their enemy without a prior appointment. And I witnessed with the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, the night of Al-Aqabah when we pledged allegiance to Islam, and I would not prefer to have witnessed Badr for it, even though Badr is more remembered by people than it. And the story of me lagging behind the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, in the expedition of Tabuk is that I was never stronger or more affluent than when I lagged behind him in that expedition. By Allah, I never gathered two riding beasts before it until I gathered them in that expedition. And the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, would not intend an expedition without showing otherwise, until that expedition. So the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, went on that expedition in intense heat, and faced a long journey and a vast desert, and faced a large number of enemies. So he made clear to the Muslims their situation so they could prepare for their expedition, and he informed them of the direction he intended. And the Muslims with the Messenger of Allah were many, and they were not gathered in a حافظ book (meaning, the Diwan). Ka'b said: So any man who wanted to stay behind would think that he would be hidden unless a revelation from Allah descended about him. And the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, went on that expedition when the fruits and the shade were pleasant. And I desired it. So the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, and the Muslims with him prepared, and I used to go out to prepare with him, and I would return without accomplishing anything, and say to myself: I am capable of that if I wish. So it continued to delay me until the seriousness of the matter intensified among the people. And the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, set out in the morning, and the Muslims with him, and I had not accomplished anything of my preparations. Then I went out and returned without accomplishing anything. So it continued to delay me until they hastened and the departure was missed. So I thought of setting out to catch up with them, and I wish I had done so, but it was not destined for me. So, when I went out among the people after the departure of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, I felt saddened that I saw an example for me, except for a man who was openly known for his hypocrisy, or a man whom Allah the Almighty had excused from the weak, and the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, did not mention me until he reached Tabuk. And he said while sitting in the midst of the people in Tabuk: What happened to Ka'b bin Malik? A man from Banu Salima said: O Messenger of Allah, his two cloaks and his gaze at his sides detained him. So Mu'adh bin Jabal, may Allah be pleased with him, said to him: What a terrible thing you said! By Allah, O Messenger of Allah, we know nothing but good about him. So the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, remained silent. While he was in that state, he saw a man dressed in white being distorted by the heat haze. So the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: Be Abu Khaythama. And it was Abu Khaythama Al-Ansari, and he was the one who gave away a sa' of dates when the hypocrites taunted him. Ka'b said: When I learned that the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, had set out on his return journey from Tabuk, my anxiety overwhelmed me. So I began to think of lies and say: With what can I escape his displeasure tomorrow? And I sought the help of every wise person among my family for this. When it was said: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, is about to arrive, falsehood was dispelled from me until I knew that I would never escape him with anything. So I resolved to tell the truth. And the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, arrived in the morning. And when he returned from a journey, he began with the Masjid and prayed two rak'ahs in it, then he sat down for the people. When he did that, the absentees came to him, making excuses to him and swearing allegiance to him. They were more than eighty men, so he accepted their outward excuses and pledged allegiance to them and sought forgiveness for them and entrusted their inner secrets to Allah the Almighty, until I came. When I greeted him, he smiled a smile of displeasure, then said: Come. So I walked until I sat before him, and he said to me: What made you lag behind? Did you not buy your mount? I said: O Messenger of Allah, by Allah, if I had sat with anyone else from the people of this world, I would have thought that I would escape his displeasure with an excuse. I have been given eloquence, but by Allah, I know that if I tell you a lie today that pleases you, Allah may soon displease you with me. And if I tell you the truth, you may be displeased with me, and I hope for the consequence of Allah the Almighty. By Allah, I had no excuse. By Allah, I was never stronger or more affluent than when I lagged behind you. He said: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: As for this one, he has told the truth. Stand up until Allah judges you. And some men from Banu Salima walked and followed me, and they said to me: By Allah, we do not know of you having committed any sin before this. You were unable to offer an excuse to the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, like the absentees did. The Messenger of Allah's seeking forgiveness for you would have been enough for your sin. He said: By Allah, they continued to blame me until I wanted to return to the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, and deny myself. Then I said to them: Did anyone else face this with me? They said: Yes, two men faced it with you. They said what you said, and it was said to them what was said to you. I said: Who are they? They said: Mararah bin Ar-Rabi' Al-Amri, and Hilal bin Umayyah Al-Waqifi. He said: And they mentioned to me two righteous men who had witnessed Badr, and there was an example for me in them. He said: So I proceeded when they mentioned them to me. And the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, forbade speaking to us, the three of us, among those who lagged behind him. He said: So the people avoided us, or he said: They changed towards us, until I became unfamiliar with the land itself, and it was not the land I knew. And we remained in that state for fifty nights. As for my two companions, they succumbed and sat in their homes weeping. As for me, I was the strongest and most robust of the people. So I used to go out and attend prayers with the Muslims, and walk in the markets, and no one spoke to me. And I would go to the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, and greet him, and he was in his assembly after prayer, and I would say to myself: Did he move his lips to return the greeting? Then I would pray near him and steal glances at him. When I turned to my prayer, he would look at me. And when I turned to him, he would turn away from me. Until that long period of the Muslims' estrangement became too much for me, so I walked until I climbed the wall of Abu Qatadah's garden, and he was my cousin and the dearest person to me. So I greeted him, and by Allah, he did not return my greeting. So I said to him: O Abu Qatadah, I implore you by Allah, do you know that I love Allah and His Messenger, peace be upon him? He remained silent. I repeated and implored him, and he remained silent. I repeated and implored him, and he said: Allah and His Messenger know best. Then my eyes welled up, and I turned away until I climbed the wall. While I was walking in the market of Medina, a Nabatite from the Nabatites of Sham, who had come with provisions to sell in Medina, said: Who can guide me to Ka'b bin Malik? So the people began to point him to me until he came to me and handed me a letter from the King of Ghassan, and I was a scribe. I read it, and it said: To proceed, it has reached us that your companion has been estranged from you, and Allah has not placed you in a place of disgrace or neglect. So come to us, we will support you. When I read it, I said: And this is also from the trial. So I put it in the oven and burned it. And when forty of the fifty nights had passed, and the revelation was delayed, a messenger from the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, came to me, and he said: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, orders you to separate from your wife. I said: Shall I divorce her, or what shall I do? He said: No, rather separate from her, and do not approach her. And he sent a similar message to my companions. So I said to my wife: Go to your family and stay with them until Allah decides this matter. Then the wife of Hilal bin Umayyah came as a messenger to the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, and said to him: O Messenger of Allah, Hilal bin Umayyah is an old man who is helpless and has no servant. Would you dislike me to serve him? He said: No, but do not approach him. She said: By Allah, he has no desire for anything, and by Allah, he has been weeping since what happened to him until this day. So some of my family said to me: Would you ask permission from the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, regarding your wife? He has permitted the wife of Hilal bin Umayyah to serve him. I said: I will not ask permission from the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, regarding her. And how do I know what the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, would say if I asked him permission regarding her, and I am a young man? So I remained in that state for ten nights, so our fifty nights were completed since they forbade speaking to us. Then I prayed the dawn prayer on the morning of the fiftieth night on the roof of one of our houses. While I was sitting in the state that Allah the Almighty mentioned about us, my soul was constricted and the earth was vast as it was, I heard the voice of a caller atop the mountain of As-Sel' saying at the top of his voice: O Ka'b bin Malik, rejoice! So I fell down in prostration, and I knew that relief had come. So the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, announced to the people Allah the Almighty's acceptance of our repentance when he prayed the dawn prayer. So the people went to congratulate us, and those who congratulated us went before my companions. And a man spurred his horse and a runner from Aslam went before me and ascended the mountain. The voice was faster than the horse. When the one whose voice I heard came to me with good news, I took off my two garments and gave them to him for his good news. By Allah, I owned nothing else that day. And I borrowed two garments and wore them, and went to the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him. People met me in groups, congratulating me on my repentance and saying to me: May Allah's repentance upon you be blessed. Until I entered the Masjid and found the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, sitting, surrounded by people. So Talhah bin Ubaydullah, may Allah be pleased with him, stood up running until he shook my hand and congratulated me. By Allah, no one from the Muhajirun stood up except him. So Ka'b never forgot that from Talhah. Ka'b said: When I greeted the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, he said, his face beaming with joy: Rejoice in the best day that has passed over you since your mother gave birth to you. I said: Is it from you, O Messenger of Allah, or from Allah? He said: No, but from Allah the Almighty. And when the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, was pleased, his face would shine as if his face were a piece of the moon, and we would know that from him. When I sat before him, I said: O Messenger of Allah, from my repentance is that I give away all my wealth in charity to Allah and His Messenger. So the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: Keep some of your wealth for yourself, for it is better for you. So I said: I will keep my share in Khaybar. And I said: O Messenger of Allah, Allah the Almighty only saved me through truthfulness, and from my repentance is that I will speak nothing but the truth as long as I live. By Allah, I do not know of anyone among the Muslims whom Allah has tested with truthfulness since I mentioned that to the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, better than how Allah the Almighty has tested me. By Allah, I have not intended a lie since I said that to the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, until this day, and I hope that Allah the Almighty will protect me in what remains. He said: So Allah the Almighty revealed: {Allah has turned in forgiveness to the Prophet and to the Emigrants and the Helpers who followed him in the hour of hardship} until he reached: {He is to them Most Merciful, Benevolent. And to the three who were left behind until, when the earth constrained them despite its capacity} until he reached: {Fear Allah and be with the truthful.} (At-Tawbah 117, 119). Ka'b said: By Allah, Allah the Almighty has not bestowed upon me any greater blessing after He guided me to Islam than my telling the truth to the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, and not lying to him, so that I would not perish as those who lied perished. Allah the Almighty said to those who lied when the revelation descended, the worst He said to anyone, and Allah the Almighty said: {They will swear by Allah to you when you return to them that you might turn away from them. So turn away from them. Indeed, they are defilement, and their refuge is Hell - recompense for what they had earned. They will swear to you so that you may be pleased with them. But if you are pleased with them, then Allah is not pleased with the defiantly disobedient people.} (At-Tawbah 95, 96). Ka'b said: We, the three of us, were left behind from the command of those whose excuses the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, accepted when they swore allegiance to him, so he pledged allegiance to them and sought forgiveness for them. And the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, delayed our matter until Allah the Almighty decreed concerning it. Allah the Almighty said: {And to the three who were left behind.} And what is mentioned is not that we lagged behind in the raid, but rather it is His leaving us behind and delaying our matter from those who swore allegiance to Him and offered excuses to Him, and He accepted from them. Agreed upon. And in one narration: \"That the Prophet, peace be upon him, went out on the expedition of Tabuk on Thursday, and he liked to go out on Thursday.\" And in another narration: \"And he would not return from a journey except during the day at forenoon. So when he returned, he began with the Masjid and prayed two rak'ahs in it, then sat in it.\" [Translated by Gemini 2.5 Flash]",

Then he, and his family and companions, prayed over her.

      "text": "It was narrated from Suhayb (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: \"There was a king among those before you, and he had a sorcerer. When the sorcerer grew old, he said to the king: 'I have grown old, so send me a boy so I can teach him magic.' So a boy was sent to him to teach him. As he was on his way, he passed by a monk, and he sat with him and heard his words, which pleased him. When he came to the sorcerer, he passed by the monk and sat with him. When he came to the sorcerer, he would strike him. He complained about this to the monk, who said: 'If you fear the sorcerer, say: My family has imprisoned me. And if you fear your family, say: The sorcerer has imprisoned me.' While he was doing this, he came across a great beast that was blocking the people. He said: 'Today I will know which is better, the sorcerer's way or the monk's way?' He took a stone and said: 'O Allah, if the monk's way is more beloved to You than the sorcerer's way, then kill this beast so that the people may pass.' He threw it, killed it, and the people passed. He went to the monk and told him. The monk said to him: 'My son, you are better than me today. Your affair has reached what I see, and you will be tested. If you are tested, do not betray me.' And the boy used to heal the blind and the leper, and treat people from all ailments. A companion of the king, who had become blind, heard about him. He came to him with many gifts and said: 'All of this is for you if you heal me.' He said: 'I do not heal anyone; only Allah Almighty heals. If you believe in Allah, I will pray to Allah, and He will heal you.' So he believed in Allah Almighty, and Allah Almighty healed him. He went to the king and sat with him as he used to sit. The king said to him: 'Who restored your sight?' He said: 'My Lord.' The king said: 'Do you have a Lord other than me?' (He said: 'My Lord and your Lord is Allah.') So he took him and kept torturing him until he revealed the boy. The boy was brought, and the king said to him: 'My son, your magic has reached such a level that you heal the blind and the leper, and you do such and such.' He said: 'I do not heal anyone; only Allah Almighty heals.' So he took him and kept torturing him until he revealed the monk. The monk was brought, and it was said to him: 'Renounce your religion.' He refused. So a saw was brought, and it was placed on the parting of his head and sawed until his two halves fell apart. Then the king's companion was brought, and it was said to him: 'Renounce your religion.' He refused. So a saw was placed on the parting of his head and sawed until his two halves fell apart. Then the boy was brought, and it was said to him: 'Renounce your religion.' He refused. So he handed him over to some of his companions and said: 'Go with him to such and such a mountain, and ascend the mountain with him.' He said: 'O Allah, suffice me from them in whatever way You wish.' The mountain shook with them, and they fell. And he came walking to the king. The king said to him: 'What happened to your companions?' He said: 'Allah Almighty sufficed me from them.' So he handed him over to some of his companions and said: 'Go with him, carry him in a boat, and take him to the middle of the sea. If he renounces his religion, fine; otherwise, throw him overboard.' They went with him. He said: 'O Allah, suffice me from them in whatever way You wish.' The boat capsized with them, and they drowned. And he came walking to the king. The king said to him: 'What happened to your companions?' He said: 'Allah Almighty sufficed me from them.' The king said: 'You will not be able to kill me unless you do what I command you.' He said: 'What is it?' He said: 'Gather the people in a single open space, and crucify me on a trunk. Then take an arrow from my quiver, then place the arrow in the notch of the bow, then say: In the name of Allah, the Lord of the boy, then shoot me. If you do that, you will kill me.' So he gathered the people in a single open space and crucified him on a trunk. Then he took an arrow from his quiver, then placed the arrow in the notch of the bow, then said: 'In the name of Allah, the Lord of the boy,' then he shot him. The arrow struck his temple. He placed his hand on his temple and died. The people said: 'We believe in the Lord of the boy.' The king came, and it was said to him: 'Do you see what you were afraid of? By Allah, your fear has come upon you. The people have believed.' So he ordered ditches to be dug at the entrances of the streets, and fire was kindled in them. And he said: 'Whoever does not renounce his religion, throw him into it,' or it was said to him: 'Jump into it.' So they did, until a woman came with her child. She hesitated to fall into it. The boy said to her: 'O mother, be patient, for you are upon the truth.'\" (Reported by Muslim) [Translated by Gemini 2.5 Flash]",

When Abu Talha returned, he asked, \"How is my son?\" Umm Sulaim, the mother of the child, replied, \"He is calmer than he has ever been.\" She then brought him his evening meal, and he ate. Afterward, he had intercourse with her. When he had finished, she said, \"Bury the child.\"\n\nThe next morning, Abu Talha went to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and informed him. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked, \"Did you have intercourse last night?\" He replied, \"Yes.\" The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, \"O Allah, bless them both.\" They were blessed with a son. Abu Talha said to me, \"Carry him until you take him to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\" He sent some dates with me. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked, \"Does he have anything with him?\" I replied, \"Yes, some dates.\" The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) took the dates, chewed them, and then took them from his mouth and placed them in the child's mouth. He then rubbed his palate with them and named him Abdullah. (Agreed upon)\n\nIn a narration by Muslim: The son of Abu Talha, son of Umm Sulaim, died. She said to her family, \"Do not tell Abu Talha about his son until I tell him.\" He came, and she brought him his evening meal, and he ate and drank. Then she made herself attractive to him as she had never done before. He then had intercourse with her. When she saw that he had had his fill and had intercourse with her, she said, \"O Abu Talha, tell me, if some people lent a family their borrowed item, and then asked for it back, would they be allowed to refuse them?\" He said, \"No.\" She said, \"Then consider your son as a gift.\" He said, \"I was left until I was defiled, then you told me about my son?!\" He went to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and told him what had happened. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, \"May Allah bless your night.\" He said, \"Then she became pregnant.\"\n\nHe said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was on a journey, and she was with him. When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) approached the city from a journey, he did not approach it by night. As they neared the city, labor pains struck her. Abu Talha stayed behind with her, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went on. Abu Talha said, \"O Lord, you know that I like to go out with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he goes out, and to come in with him when he comes in. I have been detained by what you see.\" Umm Sulaim said, \"O Abu Talha, I do not feel what I was feeling. Go on.\" So they went on, and labor pains struck her when they arrived, and she gave birth to a boy.\n\nMy mother said to me, \"O Anas, let no one nurse him until you take him to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the morning.\" So when it was morning, I carried him and took him to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\nThe rest of the hadith is mentioned.

So He sent an angel to them. He came to the leper and said: 'What do you desire most?' He said: 'A good color and good skin, and for this disease to leave me, which has made people detest me.' So he wiped him, and his disease left him, and he was given a good color. He said: 'What kind of wealth do you desire most?' He said: 'Camels,' or he said 'Cows' - the narrator doubted. So he was given a pregnant she-camel and told: 'May Allah bless it for you.' He came to the bald man and said: 'What do you desire most?' He said: 'Good hair, and for this condition to leave me, which has made people detest me.' So he wiped him, and his condition left him, and he was given good hair. He said: 'What kind of wealth do you desire most?' He said: 'Cows.' So he was given a pregnant cow and told: 'May Allah bless it for you.' He came to the blind man and said: 'What do you desire most?' He said: 'May Allah restore my sight so that I can see people.' So he wiped him, and Allah restored his sight. He said: 'What kind of wealth do you desire most?' He said: 'Sheep.' So he was given a ewe that had just given birth. These two produced offspring, and this one gave birth. So the first had a valley of camels, the second had a valley of cows, and the third had a valley of sheep. Then the angel came to the leper in his former form and said to him: 'I am a poor man and a traveler, and my journey has been cut off from me today, and I have no means to reach my destination except by Allah and then by you. I ask you by the One Who gave you the good color, the good skin, and wealth, for a camel to reach me in my journey.' He said: 'The rights are many.' He said: 'I almost recognize you. Were you not a leper whom people detested, and you were poor, and Allah gave you [wealth]?' He said: 'No, I inherited this wealth from my forefathers.' He said: 'If you are lying, may Allah return you to what you were.' He came to the bald man and said to him the same thing he said to the leper, and he responded to him the same way the leper responded. He said: 'If you are lying, may Allah return you to what you were.' He came to the blind man in his former form and said to him: 'I am a poor man and a traveler, and my journey has been cut off from me today, and I have no means to reach my destination except by Allah and then by you. I ask you by the One Who restored your sight, for a sheep to reach me in my journey?' He said: 'I was blind, and Allah restored my sight. Take whatever you wish and leave whatever you wish. By Allah, I will not prevent you from taking anything today for the sake of Allah, the Mighty and Majestic.' He said: 'Keep your wealth. You have been tested, and Allah is pleased with you, and displeased with your two companions.'\" (Agreed upon) [Translated by Gemini 2.5 Flash]",

The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) dismounted, and the people dispersed to take shade under the trees.

When we came across a shady tree, we left it for the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him). Then a man from the polytheists came, and the sword of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) was hanging on the tree. He drew it and said: \"Do you fear me?\" He said: \"No.\" He said: \"Then who will protect you from me?\" He said: \"Allah.\" In the narration of Abu Bakr al-Isma'ili in his Sahih: He said: \"Who will protect you from me?\" He said: \"Allah.\" He said: Then the sword fell from his hand, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) took the sword and said: \"Who will protect you from me?\" He said: \"Be the best of those who take.\" He said: \"Do you bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and that I am the Messenger of Allah?\" He said: \"No, but I promise you that I will not fight you, nor will I be with a people who fight you.\" So he let him go.

So, fast and break your fast, sleep and pray, and fast three days a month, for a good deed is ten times its like, and that is like fasting the whole year.\" I said: \"I am capable of more than that.\" He said: \"Fast one day and break your fast for two days.\" I said: \"I am capable of more than that.\" He said: \"Fast one day and break your fast for one day. That is the fasting of Prophet David, peace be upon him, and it is the most just fasting.\" In another narration: \"It is the best fasting.\" I said: \"I am capable of more than that.\" The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: \"There is no better than that.\" And it is more beloved to me to accept the three days that the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said than my family and my wealth. In another narration: \"Was I not informed that you fast during the day and pray at night?\" I said: \"Yes, O Messenger of Allah.\" He said: \"Then do not do so. Fast and break your fast, sleep and pray, for your body has a right over you, and your eyes have a right over you, and your wife has a right over you, and your visitor has a right over you. It is sufficient for you to fast three days each month, for you will have ten times the reward for each good deed, and that is like fasting the whole year.\" So, I strove, and he imposed stricter conditions on me. I said: \"O Messenger of Allah, I feel strong.\" He said: \"Fast the fasting of the Prophet of Allah, David, and do not exceed it.\" I said: \"What was the fasting of David?\" He said: \"Half of the year.\" Abdullah used to say after he became old: \"I wish I had accepted the permission of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him.\" In another narration: \"Was I not informed that you fast all year and recite the entire Quran every night?\" I said: \"Yes, O Messenger of Allah, and I intended nothing but good by that.\" He said: \"Then fast the fasting of the Prophet of Allah, David, for he was the most devout of people, and recite the Quran every month.\" I said: \"O Prophet of Allah, I am capable of more than that?\" He said: \"Then recite it every twenty days.\" I said: \"O Prophet of Allah, I am capable of more than that?\" He said: \"Then recite it every ten days.\" I said: \"O Prophet of Allah, I am capable of more than that?\" He said: \"Then recite it every seven days and do not exceed that.\" So, I strove, and he imposed stricter conditions on me. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said to me: \"You do not know, perhaps your life will be prolonged.\" He said: \"So, I followed what the Prophet, peace be upon him, told me. When I became old, I wished that I had accepted the permission of the Prophet of Allah, peace be upon him.\" In another narration: \"And your child has a right over you.\" In another narration: \"He who fasts eternally has not fasted,\" he said it three times. In another narration: \"The most beloved fasting to Allah Almighty is the fasting of David, and the most beloved prayer to Allah Almighty is the prayer of David. He used to sleep half the night, pray for a third of it, and sleep for a sixth. He used to fast one day and break his fast for one day, and he would not flee when he encountered the enemy.\" In another narration, he said: \"My father married me to a woman of noble lineage, and he used to visit his daughter-in-law and ask her about her husband. She would say to him: 'He is a good man; he has not shared our bed nor entered our private quarters since we were brought together.' When this continued for a long time, he mentioned it to the Prophet, peace be upon him.\" He said: \"Meet me.\" So, I met him afterward, and he said: \"How do you fast?\" I said: \"Every day.\" He said: \"And how do you complete the Quran?\" I said: \"Every night.\" And he mentioned something similar to what was mentioned before. He used to recite the seven chapters to some of his family, presenting them during the day to make it easier for him at night. And when he wanted to gain strength, he would break his fast for some days and count and fast the like of them, disliking to abandon anything he had parted with from the Prophet, peace be upon him. All these narrations are authentic, most of them are in the two Sahihs and a few of them are in one of them. [Translated by Gemini 2.5 Flash]",

I am not the one for that. Go to my son Abraham, the friend of Allah.' He said: 'They will come to Abraham, and Abraham will say: I am not the one for that. Go to Moses, to whom Allah spoke directly.' They will come to Moses, and he will say: 'I am not the one for that. Go to Jesus, the Word of Allah and His Spirit.' Jesus will say: 'I am not the one for that.' They will come to Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, and he will stand and be given permission. And the trusts and the wombs will be sent and stand on the sides of the As-Sirat, to the right and to the left. Then the first of you will pass like lightning.\" I said: \"May my father and mother be sacrificed for you, what is like passing like lightning?\" He said: \"Did you not see how he passes and returns in the blink of an eye? Then like the wind, then like the birds, and the strongest of men will be carried by their deeds, and your Prophet will be standing on the As-Sirat saying: 'O Lord, save, save,' until the deeds of the servants are accounted for, until a man comes who cannot walk except by crawling. And on the sides of the As-Sirat are hanging hooks that are commanded to seize whom they are commanded. So, whoever is scratched is saved, and whoever is thrown in is in the Fire.' And by the One in whose hand is the soul of Abu Hurairah, the bottom of Hell is seventy autumns' journey.\" (Narrated by Muslim). [Translated by Gemini 2.5 Flash]",

      "text": "And from Abu Khubayb - with the letter Khā’ prefixed and pronounced with dammah - Abdullah bin Al-Zubayr, may Allah be pleased with them both, said: When Al-Zubayr stood on the day of the Camel, he called me and I stood next to him. He said: \"My son, no one will be killed today except an oppressor or the oppressed. And I do not see myself except that I will be killed today as the oppressed. And one of my greatest concerns is my debt. Do you think our religion will leave anything of our wealth?\" Then he said: \"My son, sell our property and pay off my debt, and bequeath a third, and a third of that to my sons.\" He meant the sons of Abdullah bin Al-Zubayr, a third of the third. He said: \"If there is anything left of our wealth after paying the debt, then a third of it is for your sons.\" Hisham said: \"And some of Abdullah's children were equivalent to some of Al-Zubayr's children, Khubayb and Abbad, and he had nine sons and nine daughters at that time.\" Abdullah said: \"He kept advising me about his debt and saying: 'My son, if you are unable to do anything about it, then seek help from my Master.'\" He said: \"By Allah, I did not know what he meant until I said: 'My father, who is your Master?' He said: 'Allah.' He said: 'By Allah, I never encountered any distress regarding his debt except that I said: 'O Master of Al-Zubayr, pay off his debt,' and it was paid off.\" He said: \"Al-Zubayr was killed and left no dinar or dirham except for some lands, including Al-Ghabah and eleven houses in Medina, and two houses in Basra, and a house in Kufa, and a house in Egypt.\" He said: \"And the debt that he owed was because a man used to bring him money and entrust it to him, and Al-Zubayr would say: 'No, but it is a loan, for I fear it will be lost.' And he never held any governorship, nor collected taxes, nor tribute, nor anything except when he was on a raid with the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, or with Abu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman, may Allah be pleased with them.\" Abdullah said: \"I calculated what his debt was and found it to be two million two hundred thousand!\" Then Hakim bin Hizam met Abdullah bin Al-Zubayr and said: \"Nephew, how much debt does my brother have?\" I concealed it from him and said: \"One hundred thousand.\" Hakim said: \"By Allah, I do not think your wealth is enough for this!\" Abdullah said: \"What if it were one million and two hundred thousand?\" He said: \"I do not think you can afford this. If you are unable to do anything about it, then seek my help.\" He said: \"Al-Zubayr had bought Al-Ghabah for one hundred and seventy thousand, and Abdullah sold it for one million six hundred thousand. Then he stood and said: 'Whoever has a claim against Al-Zubayr, let him meet us at Al-Ghabah.' Abdullah bin Ja'far came to him, and he had four hundred thousand against Al-Zubayr. He said to Abdullah: 'If you wish, I can leave it for you?' Abdullah said: 'No.' He said: 'Then if you wish, you can include it in what you postpone if you postpone.' Abdullah said: 'No.' He said: 'Then allocate a portion for me.' Abdullah said: 'From here to here for you.'\" Abdullah sold from it and paid off his debt and compensated him, and four and a half shares remained. He went to Muawiyah, and with him were Amr bin Uthman, Al-Mundhir bin Al-Zubayr, and Ibn Zam'ah. Muawiyah said to him: \"How much did you value Al-Ghabah at?\" He said: \"Each share at one hundred thousand.\" He said: \"How much remains?\" He said: \"Four and a half shares.\" Al-Mundhir bin Al-Zubayr said: \"I have taken a share from it for one hundred thousand.\" Amr bin Uthman said: \"I have taken a share from it for one hundred thousand.\" Ibn Zam'ah said: \"I have taken a share from it for one hundred thousand.\" Muawiyah said: \"How much remains?\" He said: \"One and a half shares.\" He said: \"I have taken it for one hundred and fifty thousand.\" He said: \"And Abdullah bin Ja'far sold his share to Muawiyah for six hundred thousand.\" When Ibn Al-Zubayr finished paying his debt, the sons of Al-Zubayr said: \"Divide our inheritance among us.\" He said: \"By Allah, I will not divide it among you until I announce in the pilgrimage for four years: 'Behold, whoever has a debt against Al-Zubayr, let him come to us so we can pay it off.'\" He used to announce every year during the pilgrimage, and after four years had passed, he divided it among them and gave the third. Al-Zubayr had four wives, and each wife received one million two hundred thousand. So, all his wealth was fifty million two hundred thousand. Narrated by Bukhari. [Translated by Gemini 2.5 Flash]",

      "text": "And Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \"Three spoke in the cradle: Jesus, son of Mary, and the companion of Juraij. Juraij was a devout man, so he took a cell and stayed in it. His mother came to him while he was praying and said: 'O Juraij.' His mother came to him while he was praying and said: 'O Juraij.' He said: 'O Lord, my mother and my prayer.' So he turned to his prayer and she left. The next day, she came to him while he was praying and said: 'O Juraij.' He said: 'O Lord, my mother and my prayer.' So he turned to his prayer. She said: 'O Allah, do not let him die until he sees the faces of unchaste women.' The Children of Israel discussed Juraij and his worship. There was a prostitute whose beauty was admired, and she said: 'If you wish, I will tempt him.' So she presented herself to him, but he did not look at her. She went to a shepherd who used to shelter near his cell and allowed him to have his way with her, and he lay with her. She became pregnant, and they began to beat him. He said: 'What is wrong with you?' They said: 'You committed adultery with this prostitute and she gave birth to a child from you.' He said: 'Where is the boy?' They brought him, and he said: 'Let me pray.' So he prayed. When he finished, he approached the boy and poked him in the belly and said: 'O boy, who is your father?' He said: 'So-and-so the shepherd.' Then they turned to Juraij, kissing him and wiping themselves on him, and said: 'We will build your cell of gold.' He said: 'No, rebuild it of mud as it was.' So they did. And while a child was nursing from his mother, a man passed by riding a fine horse with good attire. She said: 'O Allah, make my son like this.' The child left the breast and looked at him. He said: 'O Allah, do not make me like him.' Then he returned to his breast and began to nurse.' It is as if I am looking at the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) as he narrated his nursing by placing his index finger in his mouth, and he began to suck it. He said: 'And they passed by a slave girl while they were beating her and saying: You committed adultery, you stole. And she said: Allah is sufficient for me, and He is the best disposer of affairs.' His mother said: 'O Allah, do not make my son like her.' So he left the nursing and looked at her. He said: 'O Allah, make me like her.' Then they reconsidered the conversation. She said: 'A man of good appearance passed by and I said: O Allah, make my son like him, and you said: O Allah, do not make me like him. And they passed by this slave girl while they were beating her and saying: You committed adultery, you stole. And I said: O Allah, do not make my son like her, and you said: O Allah, make me like her?!' He said: 'That man was a tyrant, and I said: O Allah, do not make me like him. And this woman, they say to her: You committed adultery, but she did not commit adultery. You stole, but she did not steal. And I said: O Allah, make me like her.'\" (Agreed upon).

The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, asked for permission to enter, and I granted him permission. He did not sit down until he asked: 'Where in your house would you like me to pray?' I pointed to the place where I wanted him to pray. The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, stood up, said the Takbir, and we lined up behind him. He prayed two rak'ahs and then concluded the prayer with Taslim, and we concluded with Taslim when he did. I kept him for a Khazirah that was being prepared for him. The people of the house heard that the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, was in my house, so some men gathered until the house was full. Then a man said: 'What happened to Malik, I don't see him!' Another man said: 'He is a hypocrite; he does not love Allah and His Messenger.'

Then I heard about a man in Makkah who was telling news. So I mounted my camel and went to him. I found him to be the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) in hiding, his people being harsh with him. I was gentle until I entered upon him in Makkah and said to him: \"What are you?\" He said: \"I am a Prophet.\" I said: \"And what is a Prophet?\" He said: \"Allah has sent me.\" I said: \"And with what has He sent you?\" He said: \"He has sent me with maintaining the ties of kinship, breaking idols, and that Allah be worshipped alone, with no partner.\" I said: \"And who is with you in this?\" He said: \"A free man and a slave.\" And with him that day were Abu Bakr and Bilal, may Allah be pleased with them. I said: \"I will follow you.\" He said: \"You will not be able to do so today. Do you not see my condition and the condition of the people? But return to your family, and when you hear that I have appeared, come to me.\" He said: \"So I went to my family, and the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) arrived in Madinah, and I was with my family. I kept inquiring about the news and asking people when he arrived in Madinah, until a group of my family arrived in Madinah. I said: 'What happened to this man who arrived in Madinah?' They said: 'People are rushing to him, and his people wanted to kill him, but they could not do that.' So I arrived in Madinah and went to him and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, do you recognize me?' He said: 'Yes, you are the one who met me in Makkah.' He said: 'So I said, O Messenger of Allah, tell me about what Allah has taught you that I do not know. Tell me about the prayer?' He said: 'Pray the morning prayer, then cease from praying until the sun rises by the length of a spear. For it rises when it rises between the horns of Satan, and at that time the disbelievers prostrate to it. Then pray, for the prayer is witnessed and present until the shadow equals a spear's length. Then cease from praying, for at that time Hell is kindled. When the shadow returns, then pray, for the prayer is witnessed and present until you pray the afternoon prayer. Then cease from praying until the sun sets, for it sets between the horns of Satan, and at that time the disbelievers prostrate to it.' He said: 'So I said, O Prophet of Allah, tell me about ablution.' He said: 'None of you performs his ablution, rinses his mouth, and snuffs water into his nose and then expels it, but the sins of his face, its eyes, and its nostrils fall away with the water. Then when he washes his face as Allah has commanded him, the sins of his face fall away from the edges of his beard with the water. Then he washes his hands up to the elbows, but the sins of his hands fall away from his fingertips with the water. Then he wipes his head, but the sins of his head fall away from the edges of his hair with the water. Then he washes his feet up to the ankles, but the sins of his feet fall away from his fingertips with the water. If he then stands and prays, and praises Allah the Almighty, and glorifies Him and magnifies Him as He deserves, and dedicates his heart to Allah the Almighty, he will depart from his sins as he was on the day his mother gave birth to him.'\" Amr bin Absah narrated this hadith to Abu Umamah, the companion of the Messenger of Allah. Abu Umamah said to him: \"O Amr bin Absah, look at what you are saying! In one sitting, this man is given this?\" Amr said: \"O Abu Umamah, my age has become advanced, my bones have become weak, and my end is near, and I have no need to lie about Allah the Almighty, nor about the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). If I had not heard it from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) but once or twice or three times, until he counted seven times, I would not have narrated it. But I heard it more than that.\" (Narrated by Muslim). [Translated by Gemini 2.5 Flash]",

I was granted permission, and I entered. He found milk in a cup and said: \"Where did this milk come from?\" They said: \"So-and-so gifted it to you.\" He said: \"O Aba Hurayrah!\" I said: \"Here I am, O Messenger of Allah.\" He said: \"Go to the people of the Suffah and call them to me.\" He said: The people of the Suffah are the guests of Islam. They do not have families or wealth. If a gift came to him, he would send for them and share in it. This saddened me, and I said: What is this milk among the people of the Suffah! I was more deserving of a drink of this milk to strengthen myself. If they come and he orders me, then I will give it to them. And what could this milk do for me? But there was no escaping obedience to Allah and obedience to His Messenger, peace be upon him. So I went to them and called them. They came and asked for permission. They were granted permission and took their places in the house. He said: \"O Aba Hurayrah!\" I said: \"Here I am, O Messenger of Allah.\" He said: \"Take it and give it to them.\" He said: So I took the cup and started giving it to a man who would drink until he was satisfied, then return the cup to me. I would give it to another who would drink until he was satisfied, then return the cup to me. Until I reached the Prophet, peace be upon him, and all the people were satisfied. He took the cup and placed it on his hand. He looked at me and smiled. He said: \"O Aba Hurayrah!\" I said: \"Here I am, O Messenger of Allah.\" He said: \"It is you and I left.\" I said: \"You have spoken the truth, O Messenger of Allah.\" He said: \"Sit down and drink.\" So I sat down and drank. He said: \"Drink.\" So I drank. He kept saying: \"Drink\" until I said: \"No, by Him Who sent you with the truth, I find no way for it!\" He said: \"Show me.\" So I gave him the cup.

He provided us with a leather bag of dates, as he found nothing else for us. Abu Ubaidah used to give us one date each. It was said to him, \"How did you manage with it?\" He said: \"We used to suck it as a child sucks, and then drink water after it. That was enough for us for the day until night. And we used to beat the leaves of trees with our sticks, then moisten them with water and eat them.\" He said: \"We set out along the coast of the sea, and we saw on the coast of the sea something like a huge dune. We went to it, and it was an animal called an 'Anbar. Abu Ubaidah said: 'It is dead.' Then he said: 'No, rather we are the messengers of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and in the cause of Allah, and you are in need, so eat.' We stayed there for a month, and we were three hundred, until we gained weight. And I saw us scooping fat from its eye socket with large water skins and cutting pieces of meat from it as large as a bull or the size of a bull. Abu Ubaidah took thirteen men from us and had them sit in its eye socket, and he took a rib from its ribs and set it up, then he loaded the largest camel we had with it and it passed under it. We took provisions of its meat and dried meat. When we came to Medina, we went to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and told him about that. He said: 'It is a provision that Allah brought out for you. Do you have any of its meat with you so that you can feed us?' So we sent some of it to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and he ate it.\" (Narrated by Muslim). The \"Jarāb\" is a known leather container, and it is pronounced with a kasra on the jim and a fatha on it, and the kasra is more eloquent. His saying: \"Namassuhā\" is with a fatha on the mim. \"Al-Khabt\" are known tree leaves that camels eat. \"Al-Kathīb\" is a sand dune. \"Al-Waqb\" with a fatha on the waw and sukoon on the qaf and then a baa, which is the socket of the eye. \"Bi-takhfīf al-ḥā\": meaning he put the saddle on it. \"Al-Sha'iq\" with the pronounced sheen and qaf: is the meat that is cut to be dried, and Allah knows best.

      "text": "Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: We were digging the trench on the day of the battle of the Trench, when we came across a hard rock which the pickaxe could not break. They came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and said: \"Here is a rock that has appeared in the trench.\" He said: \"I will descend.\" Then he stood up, and his stomach was bound with a stone. We had stayed for three days without tasting anything. Then the Prophet (peace be upon him) took the pickaxe, struck it, and it turned into a heap of soft sand. I said: \"O Messenger of Allah, permit me to go to the house.\" I said to my wife: \"I have seen something with the Prophet (peace be upon him) that I cannot endure. Do you have anything?\" She said: \"I have barley and a young goat.\" So I slaughtered the young goat and ground the barley, until we put the meat in the pot. Then I came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) when the dough had risen and the pot was almost cooked on the hearth. I said: \"I have some food. Come, O Messenger of Allah, with one or two men.\" He asked: \"How much is it?\" I told him, and he said: \"Much and good. Tell her not to take the pot off the fire, nor the bread out of the oven until I come.\" Then he said: \"Get up!\" So the Emigrants and the Helpers got up. I went to my wife and said: \"Woe to you! The Prophet (peace be upon him), the Emigrants, the Helpers, and those with them have come!\" She asked: \"Did he ask you?\" I said: \"Yes.\" He said: \"Enter, and do not crowd.\" He began to break the bread and put the meat on it, and covered the pot and the oven when he took from it, and brought it to his companions, then he took it away. He kept breaking and scooping until they were all satisfied, and there was still some left. He said: \"Eat this and send some as a gift, for the people have been afflicted by famine.\" (Agreed upon)\n\nIn another narration, Jabir said: When the trench was dug, I saw the Prophet (peace be upon him) hungry. I went to my wife and said: \"Do you have anything? For I have seen the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) extremely hungry.\" She brought out a bag containing a Sa' of barley, and we had a domesticated goat. I slaughtered it and ground the barley. When I finished, I prepared it in her pot. Then I went to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). She said: \"Do not disgrace me with the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and those with him.\" I came to him and whispered to him, saying: \"O Messenger of Allah, we have slaughtered a goat, and I have ground a Sa' of barley. Come with a few men with you.\" The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) called out and said: \"O people of the trench, Jabir has prepared some food, so come!\" The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \"Do not take your pot off the fire, nor bake your dough until I come.\" I came, and the Prophet (peace be upon him) came leading the people. When I came to my wife, she said: \"You and you!\" I said: \"I have done as you said.\" She brought out the dough and spat into it and blessed it. Then he went to our pot and spat into it and blessed it. Then he said: \"Call a baker to bake with you, and scoop from your pot and do not take it off.\" They were a thousand. I swear by Allah, they ate until they left it and turned away, and our pot was still bubbling as it was, and our dough was still baking as it was.\n\n\"A hard rock\" means a thick, hard piece of earth that the pickaxe cannot work. \"Heap\" originally means a sand dune, but here it means soft soil, which is the meaning of \"Aheyl.\" \"Hearthstones\" are the stones on which the pot is placed. \"Crowded\" means to push and shove. \"Famine\" means hunger. \"Hunger\" (khams) means hunger. \"I turned back\" means I turned and returned. \"Beast\" (bahima) is a diminutive of bahma, which is a young goat. \"Domesticated\" is that which is accustomed to the house. \"Su'ur\" is the food to which people are invited, and it is in Persian. \"Hayyala\" means come. And her saying \"You and you!\" means she argued with him and cursed him, because she thought that what she had would not be enough for them, so she was ashamed and it was hidden from her what Allah Almighty honored His Prophet (peace be upon him) with, this apparent miracle and evident sign. \"Basaqa\" means to spit; and it is also said \"bazaga\" - three languages. \"He intended\" means he meant. \"Scoop\" means to scoop, and a scoop is a ladle. \"It was bubbling\" means it made a sound of boiling, and Allah knows best.

Do you have anything?\" She said: \"Yes.\" So she brought out some barley cakes, then took her head covering, wrapped some of the bread in it, and put it under my garment and covered me with some of it, then sent me to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). I went with it, and I found the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) sitting in the mosque with people. I stood before them, and the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said to me: 'Is Abu Talha who sent you?' I said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Is it food?' I said: 'Yes.' The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: 'Get up.' So they went ahead of me until I came to Abu Talha and informed him. Abu Talha said: 'O Umm Sulaim, the Messenger of Allah has come with the people, and we have nothing to feed them?' She said: 'Allah and His Messenger know best.' Abu Talha went until he met the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), and the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) came with him until they entered. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: 'Bring what you have, O Umm Sulaim.' She brought that bread, and the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) ordered it to be broken, and Umm Sulaim squeezed a skin of ghee on it, and it became like a sauce. Then the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said what Allah willed him to say in it, then he said: 'Admit ten.' So they were admitted, and they ate until they were satisfied, then they left. Then he said: 'Admit ten.' So they were admitted, and they ate until they were satisfied, then they left. Then he said: 'Admit ten.' So they were admitted until all the people ate and were satisfied, and the people were seventy men or eighty.\" (Agreed upon). In one narration: \"So ten kept entering and ten kept leaving until no one among them remained but that he entered and ate until he was satisfied. Then she prepared it, and it was as it was when they ate from it.\" In another narration: \"So they ate ten by ten until he did that for eighty men, then the Prophet (peace be upon him) ate afterwards and the people of the house, and they left some leftover.\" In another narration: \"Then they gave their neighbors the surplus.\" In another narration from Anas, he said: \"I came to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) one day and found him sitting with his companions, with a band tied around his stomach. I said to some of his companions: 'Why is the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) wearing a band around his stomach?' They said: 'From hunger.' So I went to Abu Talha, who was the husband of Umm Sulaim bint Milhan, and I said: 'O father, I have seen the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) with a band around his stomach. I asked some of his companions, and they said: 'From hunger.' So Abu Talha went to my mother and said: 'Is there anything?' She said: 'Yes, I have some broken pieces of bread and dates. If the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) comes alone, we can feed him, but if others come with him, it will be insufficient for them.' And he mentioned the rest of the Hadith.\" [Translated by Gemini 2.5 Flash]",

And a man who is afflicted by poverty, until three men of understanding from his people say: So-and-so has been afflicted by poverty, so begging is lawful for him until he gets enough to live on, or he said: enough to sustain himself. Any other form of begging, O Qubaisa, is unlawful and consumes its owner unlawfully.\" (Narrated by Muslim). \"Al-Himalah\" (with the opening of the ha) means that a fight or something similar occurs between two groups, and a person reconciles them for a sum of money that he undertakes and commits himself to. \"Al-Ja'iha\" is a calamity that befalls a person's wealth. \"Al-Qawam\" (with the kasra or fatha of the qaf) is what sustains a person's affairs from wealth and the like. \"As-Sadad\" (with the kasra of the sin) is what meets the need of the needy and suffices him, and \"Al-Faqr\" is poverty. \"Al-Hija\" is intellect.

Some of us were setting up their tents, some were practicing archery, and some were with their livestock. Suddenly, the herald of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, called out: \"As-Salatu Jami'ah\" (Prayer is ready). We gathered to the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, and he said: \"Indeed, no prophet was before me but it was incumbent upon him to guide his Ummah to the best he knew for them, and to warn them of the worst he knew for them. And this Ummah of yours, its end has been made in its beginning, and its end will be afflicted with trials and matters that you will find objectionable. And tribulations will come, some of them making others seem light, and a tribulation will come and the believer will say: 'This is my destruction,' then it will pass. And a tribulation will come and the believer will say: 'This, this is it.' So whoever wishes to be saved from the Hellfire and enter Paradise, let death come to him while he believes in Allah and the Last Day, and let him treat people as he wishes to be treated. And whoever pledges allegiance to an Imam, giving him his hand and the fruit of his heart, let him obey him if he can. If another comes to dispute with him, then strike the neck of the other.\" (Narrated by Muslim). \"Yantadil\" means: competing in shooting arrows. \"Al-jashr\" (with a dammah on the Jim and a fathah on the Shin and a raa): are the animals that graze and stay in their place overnight. And his saying: \"Yuraqiqu ba'duha ba'dan\" means: some of them become light compared to others, i.e., light because of the magnitude of what comes after, so the second makes the first seem light. It is said: its meaning is that some of them make others eager for them by beautifying and exaggerating them, and it is said: some of them resemble each other. [Translated by Gemini 2.5 Flash]",

His son said to him: \"O my father, did not the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) give you glad tidings of such and such?\" He turned his face and said: \"The best thing we can count on is the testimony that there is no god but Allah, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.

If I had died in that state, I would have been among the people of Hellfire. When Allah placed Islam in my heart, I came to the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and said: 'Extend your right hand so that I may pledge allegiance to you.' He extended his right hand, but I withheld mine. He said: 'What is wrong, O Amr?' I said: 'I wanted to stipulate.' He said: 'What do you want to stipulate?' I said: 'That I be forgiven.' He said: 'Do you not know that Islam demolishes what came before it, and that Hijrah demolishes what came before it, and that Hajj demolishes what came before it?' And no one was dearer to me than the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him), nor was anyone more respected in my eyes than him. I could not bear to look at him fully out of reverence for him. If I were asked to describe him, I could not, because I could not look at him fully. If I had died in that state, I would have hoped to be among the people of Paradise. Then we were in charge of things, and I do not know what my situation will be. So, when I die, do not let a wailing woman or fire accompany me. When you bury me, throw sand upon my grave liberally.

That is a good deed. And raise your garment to the middle of your calf; if you refuse, then to the two ankles.

He was a recluse, rarely associating with people, spending his time in prayer. When he finished, he would engage in glorifying and magnifying Allah until he returned to his family. He passed by us one day while we were with Abu Al-Darda', and Abu Al-Darda' said to him, \"A word that benefits us and does not harm you.\" He said, \"The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, sent a detachment, and they returned. One of them came and sat in the gathering where the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, used to sit. He said to a man next to him, 'If you had seen us when we met the enemy, and so-and-so attacked and struck with his spear, saying, \"Take this from me, I am the young man from Ghifar.\" What do you think of his saying?' The man replied, 'I do not think his reward is invalidated.' Another heard this and said, 'I see no harm in that.' They disputed until the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, heard them and said, 'Subhan Allah! There is no harm in being rewarded and praised.' I saw Abu Al-Darda' pleased with this and he kept looking up at him and saying, 'Did you hear this from the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him?' He would reply, 'Yes.' He kept repeating it until I thought he would fall on his knees. He said, 'Another day he passed by us, and Al-Darda' said to him, \"A word that benefits us and does not harm you.\" He said, \"The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said to us: 'The one who spends in good is like one who extends his hand in charity and does not withhold it.'\" Then he passed by us another day, and Abu Al-Darda' said to him, \"A word that benefits us and does not harm you.\" He said, \"The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: 'What a good man Khuraym Al-Asadi is! If only he had a shorter forelock and his garment was shorter!' This reached Khuraym, so he got a razor and cut his forelock to his ears, and raised his garment to his shins.\" Then he passed by us another day, and Abu Al-Darda' said to him, \"A word that benefits us and does not harm you.\" He said, \"I heard the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, say: 'You are coming to your brethren, so prepare your mounts and prepare your clothing until you are like a mark among people, for Allah does not love obscenity or being obscene.'\" (Narrated by Abu Dawud) [Translated by Gemini 2.5 Flash]",

When the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, saw it, it rumbled and its eyes shed tears. So the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, approached it, and wiped its hump and the part behind its ears, and it calmed down. He said: \"Whose camel is this?

As for the one for whom they are a sin, it is a man who ties them up for show and pride and enmity towards Muslims; so they are a sin for him. As for the one for whom they are a covering, it is a man who ties them up in the way of Allah, and then does not forget the rights of Allah on their backs or their necks; so they are a covering for him. As for the one for whom they are a reward, it is a man who ties them up in the way of Allah for the Muslims in a meadow or a pasture, so whatever they eat from that meadow or pasture, it is written for him as good deeds for the amount they ate, and it is written for him as good deeds for the amount of their dung and urine. And if they gallop the length of their tether, running a distance of one or two leaps, Allah will write for him the number of their tracks and their dung as good deeds. And if their owner passes by a river and they drink from it, and he does not intend to water them, Allah will write for him the number of what they drank as good deeds.\" And performing Witr before sleep is only recommended for those who are not confident they will wake up at the end of the night. If one is confident, then the end of the night is better. [Translated by Gemini 2.5 Flash]",

And Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, brought three, and the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, went with ten. Abu Bakr had dinner with the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, then stayed until he prayed Isha, then returned. He came after a time of the night that Allah willed. His wife said to him: \"What kept you from your guests?\" He said: \"Did you not feed them?\" She said: \"They refused until you came, and they were offered food.\" He said: \"So I went and hid myself.\" He said: \"O Ghunthar, he insulted and reviled him, and said: 'Eat, but not to your satisfaction. By Allah, I will never eat it.'\" He said: \"And by Allah, we would not take a bite without more growing from beneath it than before, until they were full, and it became more than it was before.\" Abu Bakr looked at it and said to his wife: \"O sister of Bani Firās, what is this?\" She said: \"No, by the coolness of my eyes, it is now three times more than it was before!\" Abu Bakr ate from it and said: \"This was from Satan,\" meaning his oath. Then he ate a bite from it, then carried it to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and it remained with him. There was a covenant between us and a people, and the time expired, and we dispersed, twelve men, with each man were people, Allah knows how many with each man, and they all ate from it. In one narration: Abu Bakr swore not to eat it, and the woman swore not to eat it, and the guest - or guests - swore not to eat it, or to feed them until he ate it. So Abu Bakr said: \"This is from Satan!\" He called for the food, and he ate, and they ate, and they would not lift a bite except that more grew from beneath it than before. He said: \"O sister of Bani Firās, what is this?\" She said: \"By the coolness of my eyes, it is now more than it was before we ate.\" They ate, and he sent it to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and it was mentioned that he ate from it. In one narration: Abu Bakr said to Abd al-Rahman: \"Here are your guests, for I am going to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him. Finish feeding them before I come.\" Abd al-Rahman went and brought them what he had. He said: \"Eat.\" They said: \"Where is our host?\" He said: \"Eat.\" They said: \"We will not eat until our host comes.\" He said: \"Accept our hospitality from us, for if he comes and you have not eaten, you will incur his displeasure.\" They refused. He knew that he was angry with him. When he came, I moved away from him. He said: \"What did you do?\" They informed him. He said: \"O Abd al-Rahman,\" and he was silent. Then he said: \"O Abd al-Rahman,\" and he was silent. Then he said: \"O Ghunthar, I swear to you, if you hear my voice, come!\" So I came out and said: \"Ask your guests.\" They said: \"He speaks the truth, he brought it to us.\" He said: \"You were waiting for me. By Allah, I will not eat it tonight.\" The others said: \"By Allah, we will not eat it until you eat it.\" He said: \"Woe to you! Why do you not accept our hospitality from us? Bring your food.\" He brought it, and he put his hand on it and said: \"In the name of Allah. The first was from Satan.\" He ate, and they ate. (Agreed upon). [Translated by Gemini 2.5 Flash]",

They set out until they reached Al-Hada, between 'Usfan and Mecca. They were informed of a tribe of Hudhayl called Banu Lihyan, who mobilized about a hundred archers against them. They followed their tracks, and when Asim and his companions sensed them, they took refuge in a place, and the people surrounded them. They said: \"Descend and surrender yourselves, and you will have our pledge and covenant that we will not kill any of you.\" Asim bin Thabit said: \"O people, as for me, I will not descend under the covenant of a disbeliever. O Allah, inform Your Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, about us.\" So they shot them with arrows and killed Asim. Three men surrendered to them on the strength of the covenant and pledge, including Khubayb, Zayd bin Al-Dathinnah, and another man. When they had them at their mercy, they untied their bowstrings and tied them with them. The third man said: \"This is the first betrayal. By Allah, I will not accompany you; I have an example in these (referring to the slain).\" They dragged him and struggled with him, but he refused to accompany them, so they killed him. They took Khubayb and Zayd bin Al-Dathinnah with them until they sold them in Mecca after the Battle of Badr. The Banu Al-Harith bin 'Amir bin Nawfal bin 'Abd Manaf bought Khubayb, and it was Khubayb who had killed Al-Harith on the day of Badr. Khubayb remained a prisoner with them until they decided to kill him. He asked for a razor from some of Al-Harith's daughters to shave himself, and she lent it to him. While she was distracted, a child of hers crawled towards him. She found him sitting on her lap with the razor in his hand. She screamed in terror, which Khubayb recognized. He said: \"Are you afraid that I will kill him? I would not do that.\" She said: \"By Allah, I have never seen a better prisoner than Khubayb. By Allah, I found him one day eating a bunch of grapes in his hand, and he was bound with iron, and there was no fruit in Mecca.\" She used to say: \"This is sustenance that Allah has provided for Khubayb.\" When they took him out of the sanctuary to kill him in the open, Khubayb said to them: \"Let me pray two rak'ahs.\" So they left him. He prayed two rak'ahs and said: \"By Allah, if it were not that you would think that I am afraid, I would have prayed more.\" \"O Allah, count them in number, and kill them dispersedly, and leave none of them.\" And he said: \"Then I do not care when I am killed as a Muslim**on whatever side I fall to Allah. This is for the sake of Allah, and if He wills, He will bless my torn limbs.\" Khubayb was the one who initiated for every Muslim killed patiently the prayer, and the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, informed his companions of their news on the day they were afflicted. Some people from Quraysh sent to Asim bin Thabit when they heard that he had been killed, asking for something from him to identify him, as he had killed one of their great men. So Allah sent a swarm of bees like a canopy to Asim, which protected him from their messengers, and they were unable to cut anything from him. (Narrated by Bukhari) His saying \"Al-Hada\" means a place, and \"Al-Dhalla\" means a cloud, and \"Al-Dabar\" means bees. His saying \"kill them dispersedly\" is with a kasra on the baa and a fatha on it. Whoever says it with a kasra, he says it is the plural of \"bidda\" with a kasra on the baa, which means a share. And the meaning is: kill them in divided portions, each one of them having a share. And whoever says it with a fatha, he says the meaning is: killed separately, one after another, from dispersal. And in this chapter, there are many authentic hadiths that have preceded in their places in this book, including the hadith of the boy who used to go to the monk and the sorcerer, and the hadith of Jurayj, and the hadith of the companions of the cave who were trapped by the rock, and the hadith of the man who heard a voice in the clouds saying: \"Water the garden of so-and-so,\" and others. And the proofs in this chapter are many and well-known, and by Allah is success. [Translated by Gemini 2.5 Flash]",

      "text": "On the authority of Samura ibn Jundab (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) often used to say to his companions: \"Did any of you see a dream?\" and whoever Allah willed would narrate his dream. One morning he said to us: \"Two came to me last night, and they said to me: 'Go forth.' So I went forth with them. We came upon a man lying down, and another standing over him with a rock. He was striking the man's head with the rock, smashing it, and the rock would roll away. He would follow the rock to pick it up, and it would not be whole until his head was restored as it was. Then he would return to him and do the same as he did the first time!\" He said: \"I said to them: 'Glory be to Allah! Who are these two?' They said to me: 'Go forth, go forth.' So we went forth, and we came upon a man lying on his back, and another standing over him with an iron hook. He would come to one side of his face and rip it open from cheek to nape, and his nostril to nape, and his eye to nape. Then he would move to the other side and do the same to that side as he did to the first side. As soon as he finished with that side, it would be restored as it was. Then he would return to him and do the same as he did the first time.\" He said: \"I said: 'Glory be to Allah! Who are these two?' They said to me: 'Go forth, go forth.' So we went forth, and we came upon something like a furnace.\" I think he said: \"And in it was a noise and voices. We looked into it and found naked men and women. Flames were coming up from beneath them, and when the flames reached them, they cried out.\" I said: \"Who are these?\" They said to me: \"Go forth, go forth.\" So we went forth, and we came upon a river.\" I think he said: \"It was red like blood. And in the river, a man was swimming. And on the bank of the river, a man had gathered many stones. And the swimmer would swim and swim, then come to the one who had gathered stones, who would open his mouth, and throw a stone into it. Then he would swim away. Then he would return to him. Every time he returned to him, his mouth would be opened, and a stone would be thrown into it.\" I said to them: \"Who are these two?\" They said to me: \"Go forth, go forth.\" So we went forth, and we came upon a man with a repulsive appearance, or rather, the most repulsive man you could see. He had a fire with him that he was fanning and running around. I said to them: \"What is this?\" He said to me: \"Go forth, go forth.\" So we went forth, and we came upon a lush, green meadow with all the colors of spring. And in the middle of the meadow was a very tall man, so tall that I could hardly see his head in the sky. And around the man were more young boys than I had ever seen. I said: \"What is this! And who are these?\" They said to me: \"Go forth, go forth.\" So we went forth, and we came to a huge tree, larger and more beautiful than any tree I had ever seen! They said to me: \"Climb it.\" So I climbed it, and we reached a city built of bricks of gold and bricks of silver. We came to the gate of the city and asked for it to be opened. It was opened for us, and we entered. We were met by men, half of whose creation was as beautiful as you could see, and half of whose creation was as ugly as you could see! They said to them: \"Go and fall into that river,\" and it was a river flowing across, its water as pure white as milk. They went and fell into it. Then they returned to us, and the ugliness had gone from them, and they were in the most beautiful form. He said: They said to me: \"This is the Garden of Eden, and that is your dwelling.\" My gaze rose, and I saw a palace like a white cloud. They said to me: \"Is that your dwelling?\" I said to them: \"May Allah bless you. Let me enter.\" They said: \"Not now, but you will enter it.\" I said to them: \"I saw something wonderful last night. What is this that I saw?\" They said to me: \"We will tell you. As for the first man whose head you saw being smashed with a rock, he is the man who learns the Quran and abandons it, and sleeps through the obligatory prayer. As for the man whose face you saw ripped open from cheek to nape, and his nostril to nape, and his eye to nape, he is the man who goes out of his house and tells a lie that reaches the horizons, and he will be done to until the Day of Resurrection. As for the naked men and women who were in the furnace-like structure, they are the adulterers and adulteresses. As for the man you saw swimming in the river and being fed stones, he is the devourer of usury. As for the repulsive man by the fire, fanning it and running around it, he is Malik, the keeper of Hell. As for the tall man in the meadow, he is Ibrahim. As for the young boys around him, they are every child who died on the fitrah.\" And in a narration of Al-Barqani: \"was born on the fitrah.\" Some Muslims said: \"O Messenger of Allah, and the children of the polytheists?\" The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"And the children of the polytheists.\" As for the people who were half beautiful and half ugly, they are a people who mixed good deeds with bad deeds. May Allah forgive them.\" (Narrated by Bukhari). And in another narration: \"Last night I saw two men who came to me and took me out to a holy land.\" Then he mentioned: \"So we went to a passage like a furnace, narrow at the top and wide at the bottom, with fire burning beneath it. When the fire rose, they would rise until they were almost out, and when it subsided, they would return to it, and there were naked men and women in it.\" And in it: \"Until we came to a river of blood.\" And he did not doubt: \"And a man was standing in the middle of the river, and on the bank of the river was a man with stones in front of him. The man in the river would come, and when he wanted to get out, the man would throw a stone into his mouth, and it would return him to where he was. Every time he came to get out, he would be thrown a stone in his mouth, and he would return as he was.\" And in it: \"So they took me up the tree and brought me into a house more beautiful than any I had ever seen, with old men and young men in it.\" And in it: \"The one you saw ripping his cheek is a liar, who tells a lie that is carried by others until it reaches the horizons, and he will be done to as you saw until the Day of Resurrection.\" And in it: \"The one you saw having his head smashed is a man whom Allah taught the Quran, and he slept through it at night and did not act upon it during the day, so he will be done to until the Day of Resurrection. And the first house you entered is the house of the common believers, and as for this house, it is the house of the martyrs. And I am Gabriel, and this is Michael. So lift your head.\" I lifted my head, and above me was something like clouds. They said: \"That is your dwelling.\" I said: \"Let me enter my dwelling.\" They said: \"You have a remaining lifespan that you have not completed. If you had completed it, you would have reached your dwelling.\" (Narrated by Bukhari). His saying: \"يثلغ رأسه\" (yathlghu ra'sah) is with the letter tha (ث) and ghayn (غ), meaning: it smashes and splits his head. His saying: \"يتدهده\" (yatadahdah) means: it rolls. And \"الكلوب\" (al-kuloob) with the opening kaf and doubled lam, is known. His saying: \"فيشرشر\" (fayusharshiru) means: he cuts. His saying: \"ضوضوا\" (dawdawu) is with two mu'jam letters dad (ض), meaning: they cried out. His saying: \"فيفغر\" (fayafgharu) is with fa (ف) and ghayn (غ), meaning: he opens. His saying: \"المرآة\" (al-mir'aat) is with an open mim (م), meaning: the appearance. His saying: \"يحشها\" (yahushshuha) is with an open ya (ي) and a dammah on ha (ح) and mu'jam shin (ش), meaning: he fuels it. His saying: \"روضة معتمة\" (rawdatun mu'tamah) is with a dammah on mim (م) and sukkoon on 'ayn (ع) and an open ta (ت) and a shaddah on mim (م), meaning: abundant in vegetation and tall. His saying: \"دوحة\" (dawhah) is with an open daal (د) and sukkoon on waw (و) and a mu'jam ha (ح), meaning: a large tree. His saying: \"المحض\" (al-mahd) is with an open mim (م) and sukkoon on ha (ح) and mu'jam dad (ض), meaning: milk. His saying: \"فسما بصري\" (fasama basari) means: my sight rose. And \"صعدا\" (sa'adan) is with a dammah on sad (ص) and 'ayn (ع), meaning: elevated. And \"الربابة\" (ar-rababah) is with an open ra (ر) and a mu'jam ba (ب) repeated, meaning: a cloud.

Uthman said to him, \"What is your matter?\" He replied, \"The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: 'When you see praise-givers, throw dust in their faces.'\" (Narrated by Muslim). These hadiths are about prohibition, and there are many authentic hadiths about permissibility. The scholars said: The way to reconcile the hadiths is to say that if the praised person has complete faith and certainty, self-discipline, and full knowledge such that he is not tempted, deceived by it, or his soul plays with him, then it is neither forbidden nor disliked. But if there is a fear of any of these things for him, then praising him to his face is severely disliked. And the different hadiths concerning this are interpreted according to this detail. Among what has been mentioned about permissibility is the saying of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, to Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him: \"I hope you are among them,\" meaning among those who will be called from all gates of Paradise to enter it. And in another hadith: \"You are not among them,\" meaning: You are not among those who drag their lower garments out of arrogance. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said to Umar, may Allah be pleased with him: \"Satan never sees you taking a path except he takes a different path than yours.\" And the hadiths about permissibility are many, and I have mentioned a selection of their beginnings in the book \"Al-Adhkar.\" [Translated by Gemini 2.5 Flash]",

They followed the same path as the Muhajirun and differed as they had differed. He said, \"Leave me.\" Then he said, \"Summon the elders of Quraysh who were here from the Hijra of the Conquest.\" So I summoned them, and not two men among them differed. They said, \"We think you should return with the people and not lead them into this plague.\" So Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, called out to the people, \"I will be setting off in the morning, so set off with me.\" Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"Are you fleeing from the decree of Allah?\" Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"If anyone else had said this, O Abu Ubaidah!\" - and Umar disliked contradicting him - \"Yes, we flee from the decree of Allah to the decree of Allah. Tell me, if you had camels and they descended into a valley with two sides, one fertile and the other barren, would you not have grazed them on the fertile side by the decree of Allah, and grazed them on the barren side by the decree of Allah?\" He said: Then Abdur-Rahman ibn Awf, may Allah be pleased with him, came, as he had been absent on some errand. He said: \"I have knowledge of this. I heard the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, say: 'If you hear of it in a land, do not go to it, and if it falls in a land while you are in it, do not go out fleeing from it.'\" Then Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, praised Allah Almighty and turned back.

He spoke about him in a low tone and then in a raised tone, until we thought he was in the date palms. When we went to him, he perceived this in us and said: \"What is wrong with you?\" We said: \"O Messenger of Allah, you mentioned the Dajjal this morning, and you spoke of him in a low tone until we thought he was in the date palms.\" He said: \"The Dajjal is not what I fear for you more than that. If he appears while I am among you, I will be his opponent on your behalf. But if he appears and I am not among you, then each person will be his own opponent, and Allah is the Guardian over every Muslim. He is a young man with curly hair, his eye is bulging, as if I resemble him to 'Abd al-'Uzza bin Qatan. So whoever among you meets him, let him recite the opening verses of Surat Al-Kahf. He will emerge from a path between Sham and Iraq, and he will spread corruption to the right and to the left. O servants of Allah, remain firm.\" We said: \"O Messenger of Allah, how long will he remain on Earth?\" He said: \"Forty days: one day like a year, one day like a month, one day like a week, and the rest of his days like your days.\" We said: \"O Messenger of Allah, on that day which is like a year, will the prayers of one day suffice us?\" He said: \"No, estimate its duration.\" We said: \"O Messenger of Allah, what is his speed on Earth?\" He said: \"Like the rain that the wind follows. He will come to a people and call them, and they will believe in him and respond to him. He will command the sky to rain, and the earth to grow, and their livestock will return in the evening with their humps higher than they ever were, their udders fuller, and their flanks stretched. Then he will come to another people and call them, and they will reject his words, and he will turn away from them, and they will wake up barren with nothing left of their wealth. He will pass by a ruin and say to it: 'Bring forth your treasures!' and its treasures will follow him like the swarms of bees. Then he will call a young man full of youth and strike him with a sword, cutting him into two pieces, a throw of a target. Then he will call him, and he will come forward, and his face will be radiant, laughing. While he is like that, Allah will send the Messiah, son of Mary, peace be upon him, and he will descend at the white minaret in the east of Damascus, between two dyed cloths, placing his hands on the wings of two angels. When he lowers his head, it drips, and when he raises it, pearls like dew will fall from him. No disbeliever will find his breath but will die, and his soul will reach as far as his sight extends. He will seek him until he catches him at the gate of Lod and kills him. Then Jesus, peace be upon him, will come to a people whom Allah has protected from him, and he will wipe their faces and tell them of their ranks in Paradise. While he is like that, Allah will reveal to Jesus, peace be upon him: 'I have brought forth servants of Mine whom no one can fight. So gather My servants at the Tur.' And Allah will send forth Gog and Magog, and they will descend from every elevated place. The first of them will pass by the Sea of Tiberias and drink what is in it. The last of them will pass by and say: 'There was water here once.' And the Prophet of Allah, Jesus, peace be upon him, and his companions will be besieged, until the head of an ox will be better for one of them than a hundred dinars for one of you today. Then the Prophet of Allah, Jesus, peace be upon him, and his companions, may Allah be pleased with them, will beseech Allah, and Allah will send forth a worm in their necks, and they will wake up as if dead, like a single soul. Then the Prophet of Allah, Jesus, peace be upon him, and his companions, may Allah be pleased with them, will descend to Earth, and they will find no space of a hand's breadth but it is filled with their stench and their foulness. Then the Prophet of Allah, Jesus, peace be upon him, and his companions, may Allah be pleased with them, will beseech Allah, and Allah will send forth birds like the necks of camels, and they will carry them and throw them wherever Allah wills. Then Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, will send down rain that no house of clay or fur will be able to withstand, and it will wash the Earth until it leaves it like a mirror. Then it will be said to the Earth: 'Bring forth your fruit and restore your blessing.' On that day, a group will eat from a pomegranate, and take shelter under its rind. And the milk will be blessed, so that one gulp of camel's milk will suffice a large group of people, and one gulp of cow's milk will suffice a tribe of people, and one gulp of sheep's milk will suffice a section of people. While they are like that, Allah will send forth a good wind, and it will take them under their armpits, and it will take the soul of every believer and every Muslim. And the wicked will remain, coupling like donkeys, and upon them the Hour will come.\" (Narrated by Muslim).\n\nHis saying: \"A path between Sham and Iraq\": meaning a road between them. And his saying: \"'atha\" (عاث): with the unmarked 'ayn and the tri-dotted thaa, and 'ayth means severe corruption. \"Al-dhara\" (الذرى): with the donation of the dhal, which is the highest part of the humps, and it is the plural of dharwah, with the donation and the kasrah. \"Al-ya'asib\" (واليعاسيب): male bees. \"And two pieces\" (وجزلتين): meaning two pieces. \"And al-gharad\" (والغرض): the target at which arrows are shot, meaning he throws it a throw like an arrow throw at the target. \"And al-mahrudah\" (والمهرودة): with the unmarked dal and the mu'jam, and it is dyed cloth. His saying: \"No ability\" (لا يدان): meaning no strength. \"And al-naghf\" (والنغف): worms. \"And farasa\" (وفرسى): plural of faris, which is a slain person.

The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) began to urge his mule towards the infidels, and I held the reins of the Messenger of Allah's mule, holding it back so that it would not go too fast, while Abu Sufyan held the stirrup of the Messenger of Allah. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"O Abbas, call out to the companions of the Samurah!\" Al-Abbas said, and he was a man with a loud voice, so I called out with my loudest voice: \"Where are the companions of the Samurah?\" By Allah, when they heard my voice, their turning back was like the turning back of cows to their calves. They said: \"We are here, we are here!\" So they fought the infidels, and the call was among the Ansar, saying: \"O company of the Ansar, O company of the Ansar!\" Then the call was confined to the sons of Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), while on his mule, as if stretching himself over it, looked at their fighting and said: \"This is when the furnace is heated.\" Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) took some pebbles and threw them at the faces of the infidels, then he said: \"They are defeated, by the Lord of Muhammad!\" I went to look, and the fighting was as it was, as far as I could see. By Allah, it was only after he threw the pebbles at them that I saw their strength waning and their command retreating. (Narrated by Muslim). \"Al-Watis\" is the oven, and its meaning is: the war intensified. And his saying \"their strength\" is with the unmarked \"H\": meaning their might.

      "text": "And from Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them both, he said: Ibrahim, peace be upon him, came with Umm Ismail and her son Ismail while she was nursing him, until he placed her at the House, under a large tree above Zamzam, in the highest part of the Masjid. At that time, there was no one in Mecca, nor was there any water. So he placed them there, and placed with them a waterskin containing dates and a waterskin containing water. Then Ibrahim turned away and left. Umm Ismail followed him and said: \"O Ibrahim, where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no one to talk to and nothing?\" She said that to him repeatedly, and he kept not looking back at her. She said to him: \"Did Allah command you this?\" He said: \"Yes.\" She said: \"Then He will not let us perish.\" Then she returned. Ibrahim, peace be upon him, went on until he reached the mountain pass where they could see him. He faced the House and raised his hands and supplicated with these supplications. He raised his hands and said: \"Our Lord, I have settled some of my descendants in a valley without cultivation...\" until he reached \"...they are grateful.\" And Umm Ismail began to nurse Ismail and drink from that water. Until when the water in the waterskin ran out, she became thirsty, and her son became thirsty, and she began to look at him writhing - or he said, rolling on the ground. She went off, disliking to look at him. She found the Safa to be the nearest mountain to her on earth. She stood on it, then faced the valley, looking to see if she could spot anyone. She saw no one. So she descended from Safa until she reached the valley, lifted the hem of her garment, then ran as a person exhausted runs, until she crossed the valley. Then she came to Marwah and stood on it and looked to see if she could spot anyone. She saw no one. She did this seven times. Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them both, said: The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: \"That is the running of people between them.\" When she reached Marwah, she heard a sound and said: \"Hush\" - meaning to herself. Then she listened carefully, and heard again and said: \"You have made yourself heard. If there is any help, then help.\" Then she saw the angel at the spot of Zamzam. He struck the ground with his heel - or he said, with his wing - until the water appeared. She began to scoop it up with her hands, saying thus, and she scooped water into her waterskin, and it was gushing forth even after she scooped. And in one narration: \"as much as she scooped.\" Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them both, said: The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: \"May Allah have mercy on Umm Ismail, if she had left Zamzam\" - or he said: \"if she had not scooped from the water, Zamzam would have been a flowing spring.\" He said: So she drank and nursed her son. The angel said to her: \"Do not fear destruction, for here is a House of Allah, which this boy and his father will build, and Allah does not let His people perish.\" The House was high above the ground like a mound, where torrents would come and go from its right and left. It was so until a group from Jurhum, or a family from Jurhum, passed by them coming from the direction of Kada'. They camped in the lower part of Mecca. They saw a bird circling, and said: \"This bird is circling over water. We knew that there was water in this valley, and there is no water in it.\" So they sent one or two messengers. They found water and returned and informed them. They came, and Umm Ismail was at the water. They said: \"Do you permit us to camp with you?\" She said: \"Yes, but you have no right to the water.\" They said: \"Yes.\" Ibn Abbas said: The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: \"And Umm Ismail found this [company], and she loved to have company. So they camped, and they sent for their families, and they camped with them, until they were many households there. The boy grew up and learned Arabic from them and their ways, and they were pleased with him as he grew up. When he came of age, they married him to a woman from among them. Umm Ismail died. Ibrahim came after Ismail had married, to inspect his property, and did not find Ismail. So he asked his wife about him, and she said: \"He went out to seek provisions for us\" - and in one narration: \"to hunt for us.\" Then he asked her about their life and their condition, and she said: \"We are human beings. We are in hardship and difficulty,\" and she complained to him. He said: \"When your husband comes, give him my greetings and tell him: Change the threshold of your door.\" He said: \"That is my father, and he has commanded me to leave you. Go back to your family.\" So he divorced her and married another woman from among them. Ibrahim stayed away from them for as long as Allah willed, then he came to them again, but did not find him. He went to his wife and asked about him. She said: \"He went out to seek provisions for us.\" He said: \"How are you?\" And he asked her about their life and their condition, and she said: \"We are in goodness and abundance, and she praised Allah Almighty.\" He said: \"What is your food?\" She said: \"Meat.\" He said: \"And what is your drink?\" She said: \"Water.\" He said: \"O Allah, bless them in their meat and water.\" The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: \"And they did not have grains at that time. If they had, he would have blessed them in it.\" He said: \"So they are two things that no one is without in Mecca except that it does not suit them.\" And in one narration: He came and said: \"Where is Ismail?\" His wife said: \"He went hunting.\" His wife said: \"Will you not alight, so you can eat and drink?\" He said: \"And what is your food and what is your drink?\" She said: \"Our food is meat, and our drink is water.\" He said: \"O Allah, bless them in their food and drink.\" He said, and Abu al-Qasim, peace be upon him, said: \"The blessing of the supplication of Ibrahim, peace be upon him.\" He said: \"So when your husband comes, give him my greetings and tell him to keep the threshold of his door firm.\" When Ismail came, he said: \"Did anyone come to you?\" She said: \"Yes, an old man of good appearance came to us, and she praised him. He asked me about you, and I told him. He asked me how our life was, and I told him that we are well.\" He said: \"And did he instruct you to do anything?\" She said: \"Yes, he sends you his greetings and tells you to keep the threshold of your door firm.\" He said: \"That is my father, and you are the threshold. He commanded me to keep you.\" Then he stayed away from them for as long as Allah willed, then he came after that, and Ismail was straightening arrows for himself under a large tree near Zamzam. When he saw him, he stood up to him, and did as a father does to a son, and a son to a father. He said: \"O Ismail, Allah has commanded me with something.\" He said: \"So do what your Lord commands you to do.\" He said: \"And you will help me.\" He said: \"And I will help you.\" He said: \"Allah has commanded me to build a house here,\" and he pointed to a mound that was higher than its surroundings. At that moment, they raised the foundations of the House. Ismail used to bring stones and Ibrahim used to build, until when the building rose, he brought this stone and placed it for him, and he stood on it while he was building, and Ismail handed him stones, and they both said: \"Our Lord, accept from us. You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.\" And in one narration: Ibrahim went out with Ismail and Umm Ismail, with a waterskin containing water. Umm Ismail used to drink from the waterskin, and her milk would increase for her son until they arrived in Mecca. He placed her under a large tree, then Ibrahim returned to his family. Umm Ismail followed him until when they reached Kada', she called to him from behind: \"O Ibrahim, to whom are you leaving us?\" He said: \"To Allah.\" She said: \"I am pleased with Allah.\" Then she returned, and she began to drink from the waterskin, and her milk would increase for her son, until when the water ran out, she said: \"If only I could go and see if I could find anyone.\" He said: \"So she went and ascended Safa, and she looked and looked to see if she could find anyone. When she reached the valley, she heard. And she came to Marwah, and she did this for seven circuits. Then she said: \"If only I could go and see what the boy is doing.\" So she went and looked, and behold, he was in the same condition as if he were gasping for death. She could not bear it, so she said: \"If only I could go and see if I could find anyone.\" So she went and ascended Safa, and she looked and looked and could not find anyone until she completed seven circuits. Then she said: \"If only I could go and see what he is doing.\" Then she heard a voice and said: \"Help, if there is any good with you.\" Then she saw Gabriel, peace be upon him, and he struck the ground with his heel thus, and winked his heel on the ground, and the water sprang forth. Umm Ismail was astonished, and she began to scoop it up, and the hadith was mentioned at length. (Narrated by Bukhari) with all these narrations. \"Ad-Dahha\" is a large tree. His saying: \"Qaffa\": meaning, he turned away. ... \"Al-Jari\": the messenger. \"Wa alfa\": meaning he found. His saying: \"Yanshaghu\": meaning, he gasps. [Translated by Gemini 2.5 Flash]",

      "text": "And from Suhaib (may Allah be pleased with him), the Messenger of Allah (may Allah bless him and grant him peace) said: \"When the people of Paradise enter Paradise, Allah the Blessed and Most High will say: 'Do you desire anything more? They will say: 'Did You not whiten our faces? Did You not admit us to Paradise and save us from the Fire?' Then the veil will be lifted, and nothing will be dearer to them than the sight of their Lord.\" (Reported by Muslim). Allah the Almighty says: \"Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds, their Lord will guide them through their faith. Beneath them rivers will flow in the Gardens of Pleasure. Their call therein will be, 'Exalted are You, O Allah,' and their greeting therein will be, 'Peace.' And the conclusion of their call will be, 'Praise to Allah, Lord of the worlds.'\" (Yunus: 9-10). Praise be to Allah, who guided us to this, and we would not have been guided had Allah not guided us. O Allah, bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad as You blessed Ibrahim and the family of Ibrahim, and bestow Your blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, as You bestowed Your blessings upon Ibrahim and the family of Ibrahim. Indeed, You are Praiseworthy and Glorious. Its author (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"I finished it on Monday, the fourth of Ramadan in the year six hundred and seventy.\" [Translated by Gemini 2.5 Flash]",
